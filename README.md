## Abstract
Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the popularity of AI-enabled fitness applications has exploded. Using computer vision and deep neural networks, yoga streaming applications can offer real-time feedback to correct users' alignment. The goal of this project was to develop the first phase of research to develop such a tool. This phase classified five yoga poses using neural networks and obtained optimal results utilizing transfer learning.
